=> Exploring the Data Scientists: This projects involes using python libraries to perform Data Analysis on the Data Scienctist data collected by Kaggel. In 2017, Kaggle (a data science community and competition platform) conducted a survey on a large range of users registered as the data scientist in their platform. The survey data are broadly covered the skill set of the data scientists, the demographic of the data scientists, the feedback of the platform and many other information.This project involved
-dealing with missing values in the dataset
-Performing Calculation among the DataFrame columns
-merging two excel dataframes using pandas
-Outlier Detection using boxplot
-Finding Data Statistics
-Plotting Stacked and simple bar graph
-Performing tokenize on text column to find the most common words that in jobs posted for data scientists.


=>Evolution of Linux OS: The projects involves data analysis on the history of kernel development of almost 13 years (early 2005 - late 2017) using python libraries. The dataset used is taken from a git log file.This project involved:
-Loading a git log file using python and overview of the data
-Using groupby and aggregation function finding the top 10 values of a column
-Converting columns to date_time format and corrrecting wrong time stamps.
-Visualising the result using matplotlib graphs
